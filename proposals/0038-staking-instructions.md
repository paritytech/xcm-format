## Summary

This RFC proposed a set of new instructions to be used in the context of cross-consensus staking.

## Motivation

In this section you should describe why this is a valuable problem to solve. What use cases does
it support and who will benefit from this change? Why is this solution the best in the space of
possible solutions?

The proposed staking instructions are meant to define a general interface to perform staking that
requires work across multiple consensus systems. The goal is to standarize a minimal interface for
staking through XCM that can be used in the context of relay-chain staking, system parachain
staking and across the whole ecosystem.

## Specification

> Explain the change or feature as you would to another builder in the ecosystem.
> Describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. Any new terminology or new named concepts should be defined in this section.
> Explain the design in sufficient detail for somebody familiar blockchain to understand. Consider:
> - Its interaction with other features
> - Corner cases are dissected by example
> Provide some examples of how it will be used.

### `StakeAsset(MultiAssets, Multilocation, Multilocation)` 

Stake assets and nominate a specific multilocation.

Operands:

- `assets: MultiAssets`: The assets to stake.
- `staker: MultiLocation`: The staker multilocation account where the stake will be locked.
- `nominated: MultiLocation`: The multilocation where the stake should be allocated to.

Kind: *Instruction*

Errors: *Fallible*:

- `AssetNotFound`
- `NotEnoughFunds`

#### Examples

> TODO

### `UnstakeAsset(MultiAsset, Multilocation, Multilocation)`

Unstake assets from a specific nomination.

Operands:

- `assets: MultiAssets`: The assets to unstake.
- `staker: MultiLocation`: The staker multilocation account where the stake will be unstaked.
- `nominated: MultiLocation`: The multilocation where the stake unstaked from.

Kind: *Instruction*

Errors: *Fallible*:

- `AssetNotFound`
- `NotEnoughFunds`

#### Examples

> TODO

> How to use in staking chain and relay-chain with nomination pools
> How to use in moonbeam

## Security considerations
> The purpose of this section is both to encourage authors to consider security in their designs and to inform the reader of relevant security issues.
> Discuss here security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Go through detected threats and risks and how they affected security-relevant design decisions. Add any kind of security concerns that are worth discussing during the process of this RFC.

## Impact

- What impact does this have on the rest of the spec? Does it result in a lot of changes to other parts of it?
- Does this introduce breaking changes? How would they be handled?

## Alternatives

> TODO: why the current instructions are not expressive enough.
