## Summary

This RFC proposed a set of new instructions to be used in the context of cross-consensus staking.

## Motivation

> In this section you should describe why this is a valuable problem to solve. What use cases does
> it support and who will benefit from this change? Why is this solution the best in the space of
> possible solutions?

These instruction would be useful to achieve the following goals:

### Remote Stake

Remote Stake is the ability to lock assets on one chain and stake them on another chain. We envision someday asset hub
could be used to remote stake any asset given there is a parachain that supports staking of that asset.

### Help with minimal relay chain

We want to move towards a minimal Relay Chain with staking logic moved out of Relay Chain. Any application that wants to
stake on Relay Chain today needs to understand the underlying staking logic to integrate. When we are ready to
transition
these applications to new staking chain, this might be breaking change for all these applications. By having these XCM
instructions ready before Staking Chain is a reality, we give these applications a way to integrate with relay chain
via XCM and making it easier to transition to Staking Chain when the time comes..

### Diverse staking mechanisms across chains

These staking instructions are meant to define a general interface to perform basic staking that works across different
staking implementations. With the same set of instructions, an asset can be staked on any chain that implements these
instructions.

Note: These instructions are not meant to be a replacement for chain specific staking instructions but instead 
allow a minimal staking interface. For example, a chain might allow more advanced staking features if the staker directly
interacts with it instead of using these instructions.

## Specification

> Explain the change or feature as you would to another builder in the ecosystem.
> Describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. Any new terminology or new named concepts should be defined in
> this section.
> Explain the design in sufficient detail for somebody familiar blockchain to understand. Consider:
> - Its interaction with other features
> - Corner cases are dissected by example
    > Provide some examples of how it will be used.

### `StakeAsset(MultiAssets, Multilocation, Multilocation)`

Stake assets and nominate a specific multilocation.

Operands:

- `assets: MultiAssets`: The assets to stake.
- `staker: MultiLocation`: The staker multilocation account where the stake will be locked.
- `nominated: MultiLocation`: The multilocation where the stake should be allocated to.

Kind: *Instruction*

Errors: *Fallible*:

- `AssetNotFound`
- `NotEnoughFunds`

#### Examples

> TODO

### `UnstakeAsset(MultiAsset, Multilocation, Multilocation)`

Unstake assets from a specific nomination.

Operands:

- `assets: MultiAssets`: The assets to unstake.
- `staker: MultiLocation`: The staker multilocation account where the stake will be unstaked.
- `nominated: MultiLocation`: The multilocation where the stake unstaked from.

Kind: *Instruction*

Errors: *Fallible*:

- `AssetNotFound`
- `NotEnoughFunds`

#### Examples

> How to use in moonbeam

## Security considerations

- The cross-chain systems that rely on the staking instructions assume their conterparties respect
  that fund locks/unlocks are processed correctly in the destination chain.

## Impact

- No breaking changes; it requires a bump in the XCM versioning.

## Alternatives

- It is not possible to express the proposed staking instructions with the current XCM messages
  without overreylying on the `Transact` instruction.
